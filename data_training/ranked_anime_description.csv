The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera; the land of eternal spring; located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world; owned by the king of Marinera; the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo; which necessitates his having a bodyguard; the English MI6 agent; Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran. Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This; to Bancoran`s eternal disgust; includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6; be it noted; looks a lot like Fritz Lang`s Metropolis; while Jack`s `apartment` bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst`s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.

(Hashire; Melos!); Natsume Soseki’s Kokoro; Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) & The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito); and Ango Sakaguchi's In the Forest; Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita).

No Longer Human (Ningen Shikkaku) - A high school student becomes lost and alienated. Despondent and aimless; he falls into a cycle of self abuse; depression and drugs that taints his life for years. Told in four chapters; each chapter deals with a different point in his life and the final chapter leaves him standing alone - an empty and hollow caricature of his former self.

In the Forest; Under Cherries in Full Bloom (Sakura no Mori no Mankai no Shita) - A love story between a 12th-century woman and a mountain bandit who abducts her.

Kokoro - A 1914 tale of a young man's life journey during the Meiji era. The work deals with the transition from the Japanese Meiji society to the modern era; by exploring the friendship between a young man and an older man he calls ""Sensei"". It continues the theme of isolation developed in Soseki's previous works; here in the context of interwoven strands of egoism and guilt; as opposed to shame.

Run; Melos! (Hashire; Melos!) - An updated retelling of a classic Greek tale of the story of Damon and Phidias. The most prominent theme of ""Run; Melos!"" is unwavering friendship. Despite facing hardships; the protagonist Melos does his best to save his friend's life; and in the end his efforts are rewarded.

The Spider's Thread (Kumo no Ito) - The Buddha Shakyamuni chances to notice a cold-hearted criminal suffering in Hell. But this criminal did perform one single act of kindness in not stepping on a spider in a forest. Moved by this selfless act; Shakyamuni takes the silvery thread of a spider in Paradise and lowers it down into Hell; but it falls upon the criminal to seize the opportunity and pull himself out - if he can.

Hell Screen (Jigoku Hen) - A famous artist is commissioned by a great lord to create a series of paintings depicting scenes of the ""Buddhist Hell."" The artist is unable to paint scenes that he has not seen himself; prompting him to torture and torment the Lord's staff to create his imagined images of hell. His creative efforts taint the household; as the story descends into madness and destruction.
